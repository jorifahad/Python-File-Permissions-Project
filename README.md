# Python-File-Permissions-Project
The Python File Permissions Project is a practical demonstration of managing Python scripts in a Linux environment by creating, modifying, and executing them efficiently. This project begins with the creation of a Python script named file.py, a simple yet functional file designed to print a message, welcome to jori linux terminal, when executed. It showcases essential concepts of file handling and permission settings, which are fundamental in Linux-based systems.

The workflow starts with initializing the script by creating a new file named file.py. This file represents the Python script that will be executed later. The next crucial step is permission modification, where the file's permissions are updated to rwxrwxr-x using the Linux chmod command. This ensures that the file owner has full access, including reading, writing, and executing the script, while granting others the ability to read and execute it. These permission adjustments highlight the importance of security and accessibility in shared environments, ensuring that the file remains functional and protected.

Once the file permissions are updated, the script content is edited to include a simple Python command that prints the welcome message. This step demonstrates how Python scripts can be used to interact with the terminal, providing a personalized and engaging user experience. The final step involves executing the script in the terminal. Upon running the script, the message welcome to jori linux terminal is displayed, confirming the successful creation and execution of the file.
